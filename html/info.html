    <h1>Homelessness</h1>
    <p>There are about 498 people without shelter. 2,337 people in temporary accommodation. 15,582 sharing temporarily.
    </p>
    <p>61.3 percent of those living in severe housing deprivation were in uninhabitable housing.</p>
    <p>The largest cause of homelessness is economic hardship.</p>
    <p>Drug addicts and alcoholics are also a big cause of homelessness </p>
    <p>Homeless people are often abused and attacked, discriminated against and alienated. They are frequently sleep-deprived, under-nourished and unwell. Itâ€™s cold, dirty and humiliating living on the street. Many are there because they simply cannot see another way of dealing with things. Every one of the homeless people we work with wants a home. Most also want work.</p>
    <p>There are communities worldwide that are close to ending homelessness. They have done this by adopting a Housing First Model and focusing on ending homelessness rather than managing it.</p>
    <p>People who are episodically homeless account for 10-15% of the homeless population. Addiction, mental health issues, trauma and debt have emerged as significant issues for many of the people we work with. A mounting debt situation means that rent goes unpaid and is followed by eviction.</p>
    <p>Homelessness in New Zealand has been linked to the general issue of lack of suitable housing. The homeless population is generally measured through the country's census and by universities and other academic centres. In 2018, it was estimated that 3,624 people in New Zealand were living without shelter (i.e. on the streets or in cars), 7,929 were in temporary accommodation, 30,171 were sharing accommodation (such as by staying with others or in overcrowded buildings), and 60,399 were living in uninhabitable buildings. Homelessness in New Zealand has traditionally been reduced by the provision of state housing, similar to Germany and other developed countries.</p>
